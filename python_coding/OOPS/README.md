# Object Oriented programming (OOPS)

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritence

### 1. Inheritence

```
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class. Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
```

1. Single level
2. Multi level
3. Multiple

### 2. Polymorphism

```
Polymorphism is a term used in Python to refer to an object's ability to take on multiple forms. The term is derived from two distinct terms: poly, which means numerous, and morphs, which means forms.
```

1. Duck Typing
2. Operator overloading
3. Method overloading
4. Method overriding

### 3. Abstraction

```
An abstract class in Python is a class that is marked as abstract using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module or the @abstractmethod decorator. An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed by other classes. It may define abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. Abstract classes provide a way to define a common interface for a group of related classes.
